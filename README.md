# MedPy
Reading and analyzing Medical Images (DICOM scans) using Pydicom.

In this project I implemented volume rendering of 3D image data in [itkwidgets](https://github.com/InsightSoftwareConsortium/itkwidgets), which is a Python package enables you to volume render a 3d image in a Jupyter notebook. It can take as input ITK image, a numpy array or some other 3d image formats.
